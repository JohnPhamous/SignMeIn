            <center><p><mark>SignMeIn</mark> was an idea that stemmed from waiting in line to sign in to an organization's meeting. This organization, like many others, used an excel spreadsheet where attendees had to meticulously enter their information. <mark>SignMeIn</mark> was created to streamline that process by removing the bottleneck of checking in. We allow organizers to create unique event IDs which are then given to attendees to log in from their very own smartphone.</p></center>
